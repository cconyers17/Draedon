# COMPREHENSIVE ARCHITECTURAL KNOWLEDGE BASE FOR TEXT-TO-CAD APPLICATION

## 1. ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN FUNDAMENTALS

### 1.1 Core Design Principles

#### Form and Space
- Form refers to the shape and structure of a building
- Space pertains to the areas within and around the form
- Effective architectural design considers the relationship between form and space

#### Proportion and Scale
- Proper proportion and scale ensure elements are in harmony with each other and the human body
- Makes spaces feel comfortable and aesthetically pleasing
- Critical for structural and visual integrity

#### The Golden Ratio (1.618:1)
- Mathematical law of nature discovered by Euclid in 300 B.C.
- Creates proportions pleasing to the human eye and balanced design
- Formula: φ = (1 + √5) / 2 ≈ 1.618
- Used extensively in Greek architecture and modern buildings
- Construction method:
  1. Draw a square with compass and straightedge
  2. Find the halfway point by drawing diagonals
  3. Draw line from midpoint to corner
  4. Swing that length down to create golden rectangle

#### Fibonacci Series in Architecture
- Sequence: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144...
- Each number is sum of two preceding numbers
- When dividing consecutive Fibonacci numbers (n+1/n), ratio approaches Golden Ratio
- Examples: 21/13 = 1.615, 34/21 = 1.619, 55/34 = 1.617
- Found in nature: pineapple rows, shell chambers, flower petals, sunflower sections

### 1.2 Geometric Construction Principles (Compass & Straightedge Only)

#### Perpendicular Line Construction
1. Draw line AB
2. Choose point P not on AB
3. Use P as center, draw circle intersecting AB at points C and D
4. Using C and D as centers, draw arcs with radius > 1/2 CD
5. Arcs intersect at point E
6. Line EP is perpendicular to AB

#### Parallel Lines Construction
1. Construct line AB
2. Choose external point P not on AB
3. Draw transversal through P intersecting AB at R
4. Use compass to create equal corresponding angles
5. Construct parallel line through geometric relationships

#### Triangle Construction Methods
- Equilateral: All sides equal using compass radius method
- Isosceles: Two equal sides using circle intersection method
- Scalene: All different sides using varied radius construction

### 1.3 Mathematical Principles in Architecture

#### The Pythagorean Theorem (a² + b² = c²)
- Essential for calculating right angles in construction
- Used for roof proportions, structural calculations
- Critical for ensuring structural integrity
- Example: roof height/length ratios

#### Symmetry Types
- Bilateral symmetry: balanced around central axis
- Radial symmetry: balanced around central point
- Translational symmetry: repeated patterns

#### Geometric Shapes in Architecture
- Circles: domes, rotundas, curved elements
- Rectangles: most common building footprints
