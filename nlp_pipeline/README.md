# Advanced Text-to-CAD NLP Pipeline

## Overview

A state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing pipeline specifically designed for converting architectural descriptions into CAD models. This pipeline surpasses existing text-to-CAD solutions through advanced entity recognition, multi-modal processing, and comprehensive architectural understanding.

## Key Features

### 🚀 Advanced Capabilities

- **Multi-Level Complexity Support**: Handles everything from simple geometric shapes (L0) to iconic structures like the Oculus (L3)
- **Transformer-Based Entity Recognition**: Custom-trained models for architectural element extraction
- **Multi-Intent Detection**: Processes complex commands with multiple intents in a single input
- **Dimensional Intelligence**: Handles imperial, metric, and mixed units with automatic conversion
- **Spatial Reasoning**: Understands complex spatial relationships and architectural adjacencies
- **Building Code Validation**: Real-time compliance checking against IBC, ADA, and other standards
- **Material Intelligence**: Comprehensive material database with physical properties and specifications
- **Context-Aware Disambiguation**: Resolves ambiguities using architectural context and conventions

### 🏗️ Architectural Understanding

- **Entity Categories**:
  - Structural elements (walls, columns, beams, slabs)
  - Spatial elements (rooms, zones, floors)
  - Openings (doors, windows, skylights)
  - Building systems (HVAC, electrical, plumbing)
  - Materials and finishes
  - Furniture and fixtures
  - Landscape elements

- **Dimension Processing**:
  - Fractional dimensions ("10'-6\"")
  - Ranges ("3-5 meters")
  - Tolerances ("100mm ± 5mm")
  - Complex expressions ("3m x 4m x 2.5m")
  - Automatic unit conversion

- **Constraint Extraction**:
  - Building codes and standards
  - Dimensional constraints
  - Material specifications
  - Structural requirements
  - Environmental criteria
  - Accessibility requirements

## Usage

### Basic Example

```python
from nlp_pipeline import ArchitecturalNLPPipeline, PipelineConfig, ProcessingMode

# Initialize pipeline
config = PipelineConfig(mode=ProcessingMode.RESIDENTIAL)
pipeline = ArchitecturalNLPPipeline(config)

# Process architectural description
text = "Create a modern two-story house with 3 bedrooms, open plan kitchen 5m x 6m, and master bedroom with ensuite bathroom"
result = pipeline.process(text)

# Access extracted information
print(f"Intent: {result.intent}")
print(f"Entities: {[e.name for e in result.entities]}")
print(f"Dimensions: {result.dimensions}")
print(f"Confidence: {result.confidence_scores['overall']:.2%}")
```

### Advanced Example

```python
# Configure for complex structures
config = PipelineConfig(
    mode=ProcessingMode.COMPLEX,
    enable_validation=True,
    enable_disambiguation=True,
    enable_multimodal=True
)
pipeline = ArchitecturalNLPPipeline(config)

# Process complex architectural description
text = """
Design an iconic museum with parametric facade inspired by ocean waves,
cantilevered galleries extending 15m, central atrium with ETFE roof
spanning 40m diameter, and sustainable features including solar panels
and rainwater harvesting system.
"""

# Process with context
context = {
    "building_type": "cultural",
    "location": "coastal",
    "sustainability_target": "LEED Platinum"
}

result = await pipeline.process_async(text, context=context)

# Access comprehensive results
for entity in result.entities:
    print(f"{entity.name}: {entity.type.value}")
    if entity.dimensions:
        print(f"  Dimensions: {entity.dimensions}")
    if entity.material:
        print(f"  Material: {entity.material.name}")
```
